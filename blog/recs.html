            <br><b>2 books and 1 conversation that changed how I think about life and work</b>
            <br><i>2025-12-02</i>
            <br>
            <br>Recently, one of my clients mentioned that it'd have been helpful for me to give him a list of books to read before we started working together. I wasn't sure this was a good idea because I don't want to waste people's time by recommending books that aren't the "right medicine."
            <br><br>
            Then I realized that I recommend the same 1 or 2 books over and over. And that almost always, they have a big impact on the reader. And that the people who sign up to work with me partly do so because I’ve been through the same hard stuff as them, and that the medicine that worked for me is likely to work for them. And that transformation = insight + action, and indeed, a book can sometimes deliver the critical insight at the right time and place to tip someone into deep transformation.
            <br><br>
            So I’m following my client’s advice and sharing the 3 things that have really influenced the way I think and coach about life and work. There are tons of books out there that I agree with. I’m not recommending them here because the advice is fairly common-sensical.
            <br><br>
            Instead, I’m recommending the two books and one conversation that really changed my thinking:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. This is the work that set me straight on figuring out my goals. It’s not even a book. It’s actually just <b>30 seconds of an interview between Tim Ferriss and Derek Sivers</b>. I heard this while putting away socks at home during a staycation in Seattle when I was 27, and it's stuck with me ever since.

            <blockquote cite="https://tim.blog/2015/12/28/derek-sivers-reloaded-on-success-habits-and-billionaires-with-perfect-abs/">
              <p>Tim: When you think of the word “successful”, who’s the first person who comes to mind and why?
                <br><br>
                Derek: … My third and real answer, after thinking it through, is that we can’t know without knowing a person’s aims. What if Richard Branson set out to live a quiet life, but like a compulsive gambler, he just can’t stop creating companies? Then that changes everything, and we can’t call him successful anymore.
              </p>

            <br><br>
            2. I started reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3M7gerX Kasia" target="_blank">Urbaniak’s book Unbound - A Woman’s Guide to Power</a> during grad school, a place that notoriously inculcates grad students with the notion that they should be happy with what they get (which is generally not much) and forget about asking for what they need. Kasia’s book changed my mind about what is possible in systems of power. I think many people, and not just women, will resonate with her description of not being to say what you really mean in the moment. The book provides very practical advice on how to change that. If you aren’t sure whether to read this book, just 1 more thing: Kasia was trained both as a Taoist nun and a dominatrix. This book is life-changing.
            <br><br>
            3. When I get greedy and want to do everything on my to-do list, <a href="https://amzn.to/4ooZRnO" target="_blank">Oliver Burkeman’s book 4000 Weeks - Time Management for Mortals</a> keeps reminding me that <i>all that is futile</i> (waves hand vaguelly at everything). I was recently watching a video with a DJ who was explaining how the drop is everything in EDM. Everything before the drop is building up tension towards a big release, after which everyone goes crazy. For those of us addicted to a lifetime of hacking our productivity, Burkeman's book is the big release.
