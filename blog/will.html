            <br><b>Case Study: Will Stopped Waiting for “The Right Time” and Built His Business Instead</b>
            <br><i>2026-01-20</i>
            <br>
            <br><i>Will Borzon is a mechanical engineer and the founder of <a href="https://consul.design/" target="_blank">Consul Design</a>. He worked with me 1-on-1 for a year.</i>
            <br>
            <br><b>What made you want to work with Larissa?</b>
            <br>I was feeling very stuck. The biggest challenge I was facing was committing to and starting on this higher goal of quitting my job and taking Consul full time. My attention was spread between a lot of different things. I just had a baby. I felt that I had to maintain my full-time day job at Instrumental. I didn’t have a lot of time to work on Consul. I didn’t really know what to work on.
            <br><br><b>What was your biggest hesitation?</b>
            <br>
            I had never hired a coach before. I had some concerns about whether it would work. But I felt like I had to do something. Working with Larissa was a way to move in a direction. Our first couple conversations made me think that I should keep going.

            <br><br><b>What specific results have you achieved?</b>
            <blockquote>
              <p><i>I went from wanting my business to be my full-time job to totally doing that.</i>
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>I converted my previous full-time job to one of my largest clients and commanded a very premium retainer. I’ve had repeat business and a number of leads for new business this upcoming year. I’ve had lots of opportunities for projects that I didn’t get but are the right types of conversations to be having.</p>

                        <p>Internally, I’m generally less anxious. I have less dissonance. I’m more independent, which also has its pros and cons. It is scary. But I’m ultimately in control of the work that I get and the work that I do. It’s empowering. It’s pretty cool that you can just make a career for yourself if you need to. You don’t have to endlessly apply to jobs.</p>

                        <p><b>What was the experience like?</b><br>
                        Working with Larissa helped me get to a point where I didn’t have to wait for the perfect scenario to make that leap. I used to think, "Someday, when I have some arbitrary level of success, I’ll be able to quit." I realized that date was realistically a lot sooner than I imagined.</p>

                        <p>Here are the takeaways that I still think about:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px; text-align: left; font-size: 1rem;">
                          <li><strong>Feeling confident => acting confident:</strong> Larissa asked, if I’m so confident and believe in myself and know I can achieve something, then why don’t I do that? I realized that I am the only thing preventing myself from doing that thing.</li>
                          <li><strong>Scenario-Playing:</strong> We played out: "If I left my job, what would really happen?" It instilled the confidence that I am a problem solver who can figure things out.</li>
                          <li><strong>The Bushwhacking mindset:</strong> I’m on a specific path that might be pretty clearly laid out. I can see that I want to explore a different path, and that, in order to walk on that path, you just have to go and see, and create that path for yourself.</li>
                          <li><strong>Hearing no:</strong> I’ve gotten better at accepting that a "no" doesn't actually mean anything about me. It’s just a moment in time.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><b>What would have happened if you hadn’t worked with Larissa?</b><br>
                        There was a point where my work situation became untenable. Through our coaching, I made a stand for myself. Had we not been working together, I probably wouldn’t have sent the email that started this path of working for myself.</p>
