            <br><b>Case Study: Zach Broke Into the Food Industry With a CS Degree</b>
            <br><i>2025-10-22</i>
            <br>
            <br><i><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-schulz-/" target="_blank">Zach Schulz</a> is a computer scientist turned food applications chef. He worked with me 1-on-1 for a year.</i>
            <br>
            <br><b>What made you want to work with Larissa?</b>
            <br>I was working in a completely different field. I didn't really like what I was doing, but at the same time I didn't know what I wanted to do and I didn't know how I could even change what I was doing. So I felt very stagnant. I was concerned about not having a clear goal in place for my career.
            <br><br><b>What was your biggest hesitation?</b>
            <br>
            I had also never done coaching before and I wasn't sure if it was the right choice for getting me out of the rut I felt like I was in.
            <br><br><b>What specific results have you achieved?</b>
            <br>
            <b>I’ve made a huge career change.</b> I started out working in computer science and now I'm working in food science.
             <br><br>&bull; I've already had two paid jobs in food science.
             <br>&bull; I built a great network of people in the food industry.
             <br>&bull; I've gotten a lot more comfortable advocating for myself.
             <br>
             <br>
            Overall, <b>I just feel a lot more confident in my ability to go after my goals.</b>

            <br><br><b>What was the experience like?</b>
            <br>In the first few sessions of working with Larissa, what I like most about her style is that she would ask very direct questions. At that time, I kind of lost touch with what really motivated me and what I was truly interested in. And that was in part due to influences in my life like school and my parents. Larissa would ask questions in such a way that would cut out these external voices and help me get back in touch with these things.
            <br><br>
            Something that Larissa and I did that helped me land my first job in a completely new industry was change my job search strategy. Before I started coaching, I was applying to a bunch of different places just submitting online forms and I never really heard back from anyone. But Larissa encouraged me to narrow down my search to just a few companies that I was really interested in, and I spent a lot of time working on the applications for these. I personalized them to each company and after submitting them, I would follow up with either the recruiter or someone who worked at the company to make sure that application was seen and that really helped me get responses to my applications and eventually get interviews and eventually a job.

            Something that helped with my self-advocacy was when I was stuck with something at my job and I wanted to bring something up with my manager. Larissa would give me ideas on what to say or how to phrase it and she would also give me examples of what could be said to her response to those things. So I would feel more comfortable approaching my boss.

            <br><br><b>What would have happened if you hadn’t worked with Larissa?</b>
            <br>If I hadn't worked with Larissa, I think I would have spent a lot more time treading water in the computer science industry. Before I started coaching, I felt that I hadn't explored computer science enough to know if it was for me. And so I think I would have spent at least several years kind of trying different jobs before realizing that I really needed to make a career change. Another thing I would have done is I probably would have gone back to school to get a degree in food science. Because before coaching, I didn't realize that I already had what it took to get an entry level position in a new industry.

            <br><br><b>Do you recommend working with Larissa?</b>
            <br>I think you should work with Larissa if you feel stuck in your current career even if you don't know what you want to do or you're worried it's impossible to make a change. I think it's worth trying coaching. Something else that's helpful is being open to changing how you approach things and also being willing to put in the time to get results.

            If you are (or know) a young person ready to build a career with purpose, direction, and curiosity, let’s talk.
