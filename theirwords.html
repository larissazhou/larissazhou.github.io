            <br><br>
            Working with Larissa has been transformative. Our sessions consistently leave me feeling energized, clear, and capable of tackling the challenges in front of me. She helps me multiply my energy, clarity, and momentum—whether it’s getting out of a funk, making real progress on what matters, or simply thinking more clearly. The impact of our work together has been invaluable. It’s rare to find someone who brings this much depth, insight, and humanity to coaching. I think of her not only as a coach, but as a trusted thought partner and friend." <font color="#00cc66"><br><em>— Will Borzon, Founder, <a href="https://consul.design/" target="_blank">Consul Design</a></em></font>

            <br>
            <br>Larissa and I 'unpeeled the onion' over the course of my program and while we have had very different career paths, I was frankly shocked by her keen sense of understanding of relationship dynamics, especially the one with yourself. It was an invaluable experience where I gained greater awareness of how I move through the world, new mindsets to bring my best foot forward and also structured coaching that gave me the templates for changing my behavior to better achieve who I want to be and how to get there. <font color="#00cc66"><br><em>- Janet, Strategy Consultant</em></font>

            <br>
            <br>I had felt stuck in my career for quite some time. Working with Larissa helped me get started, clarify where I wanted to go, and better understand what was holding me back. Larissa challenged my mindset in helpful and surprising ways. She identified assumptions that I had not appreciated before, and followed with advice that felt incredibly to-the-point. Her honest, yet understanding and motivating communication style inspired me. I recommend Larissa to anyone needing help with taking the next step in their career.<font color="#00cc66"><br><em>- A.S., Data Scientist</em></font>

            <br>
            <br>Working with Larissa was a transformative experience. I came to her looking for clarity on the next stage of my career, and through her thoughtful combination of 1-on-1 sessions, well-designed homework assignments, and timely asynchronous discussions, I gained a deeper understanding of my goals. Each session felt incredibly productive, and I left feeling more excited and confident about my future. Larissa's approach is perfect for anyone in a leadership role who is ready for self-discovery and growth. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for guidance in their career journey. <font color="#00cc66"><br><em>- J.L., CTO</em></font>
