                    "Larissa and I 'unpeeled the onion' over the course of my program and while we have had very different career paths, I was frankly shocked by her keen sense of understanding of relationship dynamics, especially the one with yourself. It was an invaluable experience where I gained greater awareness of how I move through the world, new mindsets to bring my best foot forward and also structured coaching that gave me the templates for changing my behavior to better achieve who I want to be and how to get there. <br>- <em>Janet, Strategy Consultant</em>

Working with Larissa helped me get started, clarify where I wanted to go, and better understand what was holding me back. Larissa challenged my mindset in helpful and surprising ways. She identified assumptions that I had not appreciated before, and followed with advice that felt incredibly to-the-point. Her honest, yet understanding and motivating communication style inspired me. I recommend Larissa to anyone needing help with taking the next step in their career. <br>- <em>A.S., Data Scientist</em>
