            <b><font color="#00cc66">WELCOME TO THE CIRCUS</font></b>
            <br>The circus is for the misfits, the bold, the brave, and the wildly curious.
            <br><br>
            Being in the circus isn’t for everyone. Most people are content to sit in the audience. For some, though, there’s no other place they’d rather be. They can’t imagine life without the adventure, the curiosity, the audacious leaps into the unknown.
            <br><br>
            If you’re here, it’s because you belong in the circus. You embrace the thrill of the tightrope and the challenge of juggling a million ideas at once. But life in the circus isn’t always easy:
            <br>
            <br>&bull; The rules of the “real world” weigh you down with ideas about what’s good, correct, or possible.
            <br>&bull; Your boldness and curiosity often come with self-doubt, hesitation, or the feeling of being misunderstood.
            <br>&bull; Extraordinary achievement seems to require extraodinary suffering. Sometimes, you wonder if being just a little more “normal” would bring more contentment—and whether the trade-off is worth it.
            <br><br>
            <b><font color="#00cc66">WORK WITH ME</font></b>
            <br> You don’t have to choose between bold ambition and contentment.
            <br><br>How do I know this is possible? Because I'm doing the work in <a href="https:/larissazhou.github.io/mycoachingstory.html" target="_blank">my own life</a>.
            <br><br>Together, we can untangle the stories and expectations that are weighing you down—the ones that tell you success must be hard, relentless, and lonely.
            <br><br>When we work together, we’ll focus on:
            <br>&bull; Unpacking the angst: Understanding why certain patterns keep showing up and how to move through them.
            <br>&bull; Making bold choices with ease: Finding the intersection of your ambition and values so decisions feel clear and energizing.
            <br>&bull; Creating extraordinary results without extraordinary suffering: Building systems and practices that sustain your creativity, curiosity, and joy—so the circus doesn’t feel like a grind.

            <br><br><b><font color="#00cc66">THE PROCESS</font></b>
            <br>I coach based on skills that help me deeply understand your situation—whether it’s identifying patterns you can’t see, asking the right questions to unlock clarity, or helping you cut through fear and take action.

            <br><br>Here’s how I do that:

            <br>&bull; Pattern Recognition – I quickly identify underlying themes and repeating struggles, even when they seem like isolated problems.
            <br>&bull; Asking the Right Questions – I don’t do surface-level. I ask the kinds of questions that cut through the noise and force real clarity.
            <br>&bull; Decoding Internal Roadblocks – I help you name and dismantle the unspoken fears, limiting beliefs, and invisible “rules” that have been keeping you stuck.
            <br>&bull; Seeing the Big Picture – I zoom out to help you see the long-term vision, then help you make the next immediate move.
            <br>&bull; Translating Uncertainty into Action – I help you break out of overthinking mode by designing small, clear next steps that actually get you moving.
            <br>&bull; Holding Space Without Judgment – I create an environment where you can be brutally honest with yourself, without shame, pressure, or expectations.

            <br><br>"What do we actually talk about during our sessions?" "But how can you coach me if you haven’t lived my career?" I answer these questions and more in <a href="https:/larissazhou.github.io/FAQs.html" target="_blank">FAQs</a>.
