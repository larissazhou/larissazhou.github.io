            <font color="#00cc66">What does coaching look like with you?</font>
            <br>I offer 1:1 and group coaching programs customized to fit your needs. At the start of the program, we establish a curriculum of topics to cover over a set number of sessions. I recommend that all new clients start on a weekly or biweekly basis to build momentum. We meet for an hour by video call, and I also provide asynchronous support in between sessions via messaging. I assign homework! My goal is to not only to help you achieve your current goals but also to equip you with the meta-level tools to coach yourself, so that you increase your capacity to take on even bolder and thrilling endeavors in the future. Once the initial program is finished, I offer follow-up packages for tune-ups as needed. 

            <br><br><font color="#00cc66">What are examples of topics you've coached on?</font>
            <br>&bull; I feel stagnant at my current job. But there are a lot of risks to changing jobs. Help me figure out what I really want to do...
            <br>&bull; I've decided to take a sabbatical. I'm both excited and terrified. Help me navigate this new experience and make the most of it...
            <br>&bull; When I first started this job, I loved the core essence of my work, but thanks to a combination of factors, I'm now burnt out. How do I recover? How do I not burn out in the first place? What personal beliefs and habits led me here? How do I fill my own cup and show up differently to advance systemic change in my workplace?
            <br>&bull; Being a woman or other under-represented minority in STEM. ('nuff said)
            <br>&bull; What if I don't see my dream job reflected in the market? Do I have to settle? (Psst..definitely not.)
            <br>&bull; I think I want a career in food. But I'm not sure what kinds of jobs are out there and what would be a good fit for me...

            <br><br><font color="#00cc66">I've never worked with a coach before. How do I know if I need coaching?</font>
            <br> No one <i>needs</i> coaching. But do you <i>want</i> coaching? For some aspects of my life, at certain times, I <i>want</i> someone who holds me accountable to my dreams and who challenges the negative stories I love to cling to. What about you - what do <i>you</i> want?

            <br><br><font color="#00cc66">What are your coaching credentials?</font>
            <br>I have 10+ years of mentoring early career folks in the food industry. At Harvard, I was a leader of <a href="https://intouch.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">SEAS InTouch</a>, a peer advising group supporting engineering graduate students. I'm a graduate of the <a href="https://www.convu.com/hupci" target="_blank">Harvard Peer Coaching Initiative</a> and have hosted webinars on graduate research in collaboration with the <a href="https://academicresourcecenter.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Academic Resource Center</a>. I have learned immensely during my own coaching journey with coaches including <a href="https://judyhucounseling.com/" target="_blank">Judy Hu</a>, <a href="https://schoolofnewfeministthought.com/" target="_blank">Kara Loewentheil</a>, <a href="https://www.michellekevill.com/" target="_blank">Michelle Kevill</a> and <a href=https://www.kasiaurbaniak.com/ target="_blank">Kasia Urbaniak</a>.
