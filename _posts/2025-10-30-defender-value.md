Have you ever found yourself doing something that you really want to stop doing, but you keep going anyways?

A few examples:
* R is bored working on his current company but is reluctant to start something new
* Z continues putting in the hours at a company that irritates her morals
* B wants to feel content in his business but is always anxiously plotting for the next big win

Usually, people will conclude that they’re not very disciplined. Not disciplined enough to start a new business, not disciplined enough to steer the project in a more fulfilling direction, not disciplined enough to find peace in the present moment.

But being trapped in these cycles aren't really about insufficient willpower or motivation. They are about something much deeper.

I put together this short worksheet called **Find Your Defender Value**. It’s a 10-minute reflection to help you spot what your patterns are really protecting.

Every behavior makes sense in context. It was your best attempt to meet a real need. By understanding these patterns, you can begin to update the old contracts that keep them in charge and create a life that aligns with your true values.
