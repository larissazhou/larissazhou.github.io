      While studying physics at Harvard, Larissa thought about food all the time. At age 24, she was hired by former Microsoft CTO Nathan Myhrvold to become the chief food scientist at his company Modernist Cuisine. Over 5 years, Larissa grew out the technical R&D team of food researchers and chefs to conduct thousands of experiments on the science of dough and bread, culminating in the publication of the award-winning Modernist Bread.
      <br><br>In 2018, Larissa started a PhD in Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering at Harvard, focusing on space food technology. She developed and built a cooking device for microgravity, won awards from NASA, and pushed thought leadership on human space exploration. She received her PhD in 2024 and is excited to expand her research to address food security on Earth.
      <br><br>A firm believer in taking a sabbatical every 5 years, Larissa is currently in her third sabbatical, <a href="https://larissazhou.github.io/climbing.html" target="_blank">climbing</a>, resting, synthesizing.

    <h4>Messy Reality</h4>
    <font size="-1"><p>Larissa's career has been exhilarating but also exhausting. She often pushed herself to the limit, neglecting her well-being in the process. Sabbaticals are great, but maybe she didn't have to burn out so hard in order to earn some rest.
    <br><br>
    Therapy helped her understand the source of her favorite unhealthy coping mechanisms. But it was through coaching that Larissa learned to shift to healthier behaviors that unlocked immense new possibilities around work, power, family, money, rest, and more. She realized she could achieve her dreams without sacrificing her well-being.
    <br><br>Now, Larissa is passionate about paying it forward, helping others cultivate a playful, mutually beneficial relationship to their career. She knows firsthand the power of self-awareness and balance, and she's committed to guiding others towards a more sustainable path.

            <font color="#00cc66">CREDENTIALS AND EXPERIENCE</font>
            <br>Harvard College - BS in Physics, Minor in Social Anthropology
            <br>Harvard College - PhD in Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering
            <br>Graduate of Harvard University's Peer Coaching Initiative
            <br>Co-leader of InTouch, a peer mentoring program at Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences
            <br>Graduate of 600-hr Certified Massage Therapist program from the Denver Integrative Massage School
            <br><br>
            At age 24, she became the chief food scientist at <a href="https://modernistcuisine.com/" target="_blank">Modernist Cuisine</a>, founded by former Microsoft CTO Nathan Myhrvold. Mandated to learn everything there is to know about the science of bread and dough, Larissa led a team of chefs and scientists to conduct thousands of experiments on the science of cooking in Modernist Cuisine’s cooking laboratory in Seattle. She also took it upon herself to scour the world to chase the esoteric and the obscure about bread. This led her to the Svalbard Seed Bank in Norway, an industrial bread conference in Paris, and small-batch stone mills in Maine. Larissa and her team’s work culminated in the publication of the 5-volume encyclopedic <a href="https://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-bread/" target="_blank">Modernist Bread</a>, which received positive reviews in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Wired Magazine and has won both a James Beard Award and an IACP Award.
            <br><br>
            After 5 years, Larissa left Modernist Cuisine to take a sabbatical and develop her own ideas. She'd eaten many freeze-dried meals while rock climbing in the Cascades and was curious to improve the eating experiences of people in extreme environments.
            <br><br>
            In 2018, Larissa started a PhD in mechanical engineering and materials science at Harvard that gave her the freedom to develop her own research agenda. She independently applied for and received a $320,000 grant from NASA that funded her research to develop cooking technologies for space. To promote thought leadership on space food, Larissa collaborated with NASA engineers to develop a space food technology roadmap for different mission scenarios. She designed and built a pot that keeps food and water in place during cooking in microgravity. She got to test the pot on parabolic flights, aka the vomit comet - twice!
            <br><br>
            Larissa found herself combining her life-long interest in space exploration (she'd wanted to be an astronaut since age 11) and her professional passion in food science. This was both incredible and scary.

            While majoring in physics at Harvard College, Larissa spent her free time cooking and thinking about food. She experimented with potential food careers by staging in restaurants, writing about food, and working in cooking labs run by Michelin-starred chefs including René Redzepi, David Chang, José Andrés, Ferran Adrià, and Dan Barber.

            At age 24, she became the chief food scientist at <a href="https://modernistcuisine.com/" target="_blank">Modernist Cuisine</a>, founded by former Microsoft CTO Nathan Myhrvold.

            As she advanced in her career, she noticed that she was headed towards burn-out, once again, if she wasn't careful. The particular culture of academia encouraged some of her unhealthiest and most deeply-ingrained behaviors: a glorification of overwork led her to being constantly "on," a rigid adherence to hierarchy caused her to weight others' opinions more heavily and ignore her own scientific intuition. Worst of all was witnessing other academics in the same boat and hearing from them that the imbalance of power was too strong to do anything about it, not if one wanted to succeed.
            <br><br>
            Was she doomed to a cycle of going hard and fast in a demanding job for 5 years and then being forced to take a year long sabbatical to recover? Sabbaticals are great, but maybe she didn't have to burn out so hard in order to earn some rest.
            <br><br>
            The real story:<br>
            I had some preconceived ideas about how I shouldn't need help or how it was more value to figure things out on my own. Eventually, I realized that, as a life longer learner, identity as a life long learner and investing in my learning means working with professionals to teach and guide me. I applied that to my climbing (uphill athlete), to gaining clarity in my personal relationships (Judy Hu), to showing up boldly in professional spaces so that I can get what I want (Kara Loewentheil, Kasia Urbaniak).

            My PhD journey contained some of the toughest professional experiences I'd ever gone through; the coping mechanisms that kept me previously "successful" in undergrad and industry weren't adequate. The turning point came when I decided to get help to transform old habits that were no longer serving me and create new habits for how I wanted to show up in the world. I got a ton of individual and group coaching in various contexts, on topics such as boundaries, power, women in STEM, perfectionism, etc. The result was that I turned my PhD journey around. Instead of burning out, I ended up crafting a PhD and dissertation experience that was uniquely me, incredibly fulfilling, and professionally successful without coming at the expense of my well-being.

            As I learned to use my power, I mentored friends and colleagues who were stuck in their own seemingly-intractable situations. Many of them had been exactly where I was,
