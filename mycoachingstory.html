    <font color="#000000"><h3>The Shiny, <br>Official Story</h3>
    <font size="-1"><p>While studying physics at Harvard College, Larissa found herself thinking about food in all her free time. She wrote about food, staged in restaurants, and interned in culinary labs. She particularly loved working with curious chefs and using science to explain everyday phenomena in the kitchen.
      <br><br> At age 24, she was hired by former Microsoft CTO Nathan Myhrvold to become the chief food scientist at his company Modernist Cuisine. Over 5 years, Larissa grew out the technical R&D team of food researchers and chefs to conduct thousands of experiments on the science of dough and bread. She worked with Modernist Cuisine's editoral and photo teams to translate experimental findings into elegant text and beautiful photos and infographics that explained the science behind the 1000+ bread recipes developed by the culinary team. Larissa's curiosity also led her all over the world to chase the esoteric and the obscure about bread: from bread conferences in Paris and small-batch stone mills in Maine to the Svalbard Seed Bank in the Arctic Circle of Norway. The team's work culminated in the publication of the 50-lb, 5-volume Modernist Bread, which received positive reviews in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Wired Magazine and won both a James Beard Award and an IACP Award.
      <br><br> After 5 years at Modernist Cuisine, Larissa knew a lot about the science of food but was frustrated by her inability to change the hardware involved in food processing. She wanted to design better food and cooking tools for people in extreme environments with limited access to resources. Such a problem required a level of deep contemplation that Larissa couldn't sustain while working a full-time job, so she left Modernist Cuisine to take a year-long sabbatical.
      <br><br> In 2018, Larissa enrolled in a PhD program in Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering from Harvard University. In her first year, she secured the NASA Space Technology Graduate Research award, which amounted to $320K over 4 years, ensuring that she would have creative freedom to pursue her own research agenda. Although she hadn't initially planned on it, her ideas evolved towards developing innovative food technology for spaceflight - the ultimate extreme environment. She teamed up with aerospace engineers and plants scientists to develop a novel greenhouse concept for Mars that won the Most Innovative Award at NASA's BIG Idea Challenge in 2019. She learned all the steps of hardware prototyping, from CAD to fabrication, to design H0TP0T, a cooking pot that keeps food and water in place in microgravity. She flew and tested H0TP0T on a microgravity parabolic flight - twice! To get more researchers in food and space interested in pushing the boundaries of space food, Larissa teamed up with researchers at Johnson Space Center to develop a comprehensive technology roadmap that can guide space food R&D for the upcoming years and decades. She defended her PhD in 2023 and officially graduated from Harvard in 2024.

    <h3>...The Messy, <br>Behind the Scenes</h3>
    <font size="-1"><p>As Larissa advanced in her career, she noticed a pattern of going hard and fast at work, exhilarated and buoyed by the thrill of chasing her ambitions. But it came at a cost. She didn't sleep enough. She didn't exercise enough. She was short and irritable to friends and family more often than she liked. She liked her habit of taking a year-long sabbatical every 5 years, but maybe she didn't have to burn out so hard in order to earn some rest. Larissa was battered and exhausted by her extreme relationship to work and the creative process.
      <br><br>Therapy helped her understand the source of her favorite unhealthy coping mechanisms. After all, perfectionism, tying self-worth to achievement, and people pleasing were part and parcel of her socialization as an immigrant, a high achiever, and a woman.
      <br><br>She'd gotten to fulfill some of her biggest professional and personal dreams while battling so much angst and self-doubt. How much farther could she go if she learned to manage even a small fraction of those darkness-of-the-soul moments?
      <br><br>Larissa's coaches helped her hone the internal compass that'd led her to design an authentic, deeply fulfilling life. They also helped her shift to healthier behaviors that unlocked immense new possibilities around work, power, family, money, rest, and more.
      <br><br>At the root of all her endeavors, After receiving so much coaching and self-coaching, so that she can live life fully and authentically, knowing that she's equipped to face whatever comes her way. And now she wants to pay it forward!</font></font>

            At age 24, she became the chief food scientist at <a href="https://modernistcuisine.com/" target="_blank">Modernist Cuisine</a>, founded by former Microsoft CTO Nathan Myhrvold. Mandated to learn everything there is to know about the science of bread and dough, Larissa led a team of chefs and scientists to conduct thousands of experiments on the science of cooking in Modernist Cuisine’s cooking laboratory in Seattle. She also took it upon herself to scour the world to chase the esoteric and the obscure about bread. This led her to the Svalbard Seed Bank in Norway, an industrial bread conference in Paris, and small-batch stone mills in Maine. Larissa and her team’s work culminated in the publication of the 5-volume encyclopedic <a href="https://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-bread/" target="_blank">Modernist Bread</a>, which received positive reviews in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Wired Magazine and has won both a James Beard Award and an IACP Award.
            <br><br>
            After 5 years, Larissa left Modernist Cuisine to take a sabbatical and develop her own ideas. She'd eaten many freeze-dried meals while rock climbing in the Cascades and was curious to improve the eating experiences of people in extreme environments.
            <br><br>
            In 2018, Larissa started a PhD in mechanical engineering and materials science at Harvard that gave her the freedom to develop her own research agenda. She independently applied for and received a $320,000 grant from NASA that funded her research to develop cooking technologies for space. To promote thought leadership on space food, Larissa collaborated with NASA engineers to develop a space food technology roadmap for different mission scenarios. She designed and built a pot that keeps food and water in place during cooking in microgravity. She got to test the pot on parabolic flights, aka the vomit comet - twice!
            <br><br>
            Larissa found herself combining her life-long interest in space exploration (she'd wanted to be an astronaut since age 11) and her professional passion in food science. This was both incredible and scary.

            While majoring in physics at Harvard College, Larissa spent her free time cooking and thinking about food. She experimented with potential food careers by staging in restaurants, writing about food, and working in cooking labs run by Michelin-starred chefs including René Redzepi, David Chang, José Andrés, Ferran Adrià, and Dan Barber.

            At age 24, she became the chief food scientist at <a href="https://modernistcuisine.com/" target="_blank">Modernist Cuisine</a>, founded by former Microsoft CTO Nathan Myhrvold.

            As she advanced in her career, she noticed that she was headed towards burn-out, once again, if she wasn't careful. The particular culture of academia encouraged some of her unhealthiest and most deeply-ingrained behaviors: a glorification of overwork led her to being constantly "on," a rigid adherence to hierarchy caused her to weight others' opinions more heavily and ignore her own scientific intuition. Worst of all was witnessing other academics in the same boat and hearing from them that the imbalance of power was too strong to do anything about it, not if one wanted to succeed.
            <br><br>
            Was she doomed to a cycle of going hard and fast in a demanding job for 5 years and then being forced to take a year long sabbatical to recover? Sabbaticals are great, but maybe she didn't have to burn out so hard in order to earn some rest.
            <br><br>
            The real story:<br>
            I had some preconceived ideas about how I shouldn't need help or how it was more value to figure things out on my own. Eventually, I realized that, as a life longer learner, identity as a life long learner and investing in my learning means working with professionals to teach and guide me. I applied that to my climbing (uphill athlete), to gaining clarity in my personal relationships (Judy Hu), to showing up boldly in professional spaces so that I can get what I want (Kara Loewentheil, Kasia Urbaniak).

            My PhD journey contained some of the toughest professional experiences I'd ever gone through; the coping mechanisms that kept me previously "successful" in undergrad and industry weren't adequate. The turning point came when I decided to get help to transform old habits that were no longer serving me and create new habits for how I wanted to show up in the world. I got a ton of individual and group coaching in various contexts, on topics such as boundaries, power, women in STEM, perfectionism, etc. The result was that I turned my PhD journey around. Instead of burning out, I ended up crafting a PhD and dissertation experience that was uniquely me, incredibly fulfilling, and professionally successful without coming at the expense of my well-being.

            As I learned to use my power, I mentored friends and colleagues who were stuck in their own seemingly-intractable situations. Many of them had been exactly where I was,
