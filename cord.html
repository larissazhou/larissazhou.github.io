            <br><b><font color="#dac05b">Cordillera Blanca, June 2023</font></b>
	<br>
Give me rock any day over snow. But somehow I found myself doing 3 glaciated climbs in the Cordillera Blanca last month. It was all due to what happened on the Owen-Spalding route on the Grand Teton last Aug. I had run out of steam after an approach with a 6k ft vertical gain. The bonk hit me quickly and it hit me hard. I sat down at the Upper Saddle and started crying out of frustration. I looked at the 3 rock pitches above me, knowing I could do them in approach shoes any other day. But up there at ~13,000 ft, I was light-headed and woozy. If we continued up, I’d be a liability to my partner Carlo (fellow HMC’er), even on 5.4 terrain. We turned around, and I resolved to work on my endurance in the mountains. I had no chance of doing the remote alpine rock routes that were my long-term goals if I used up all my gas on the approach.
 
After returning to Cambridge last fall, we learned that Carlo would be spending the spring of 2023 in Peru for work. We envisioned spending June 2023 based in Huaráz, the central hub for trekking and mountaineering in the Cordillera Blanca. We’d work remotely during the weekdays and climb peaks on the weekends. Carlo suggested starting with a couple smaller mountains and then going for a 6000m+ peak, ideally Huascarán, a hulk of a mountain and the highest in Peru. Huascarán felt like a stretch goal. It’d really force me to train my endurance. I’d also have to brush up on glacier skills. The last (and highest) mountain I’d done was Rainier, back in 2017.
