            <br>
            Food is crucial to maintaining the physical and psychological health of humans in space. Eating food provides nutrients and energy. Preparing food can promote relaxation and creativity. Sharing food improves crew cohesion. But most foods are perishable, bulky, and heavy. For deep space missions, it is not feasible to ship all the food from Earth. Instead, growing and processing crops during deep space missions “represents the greatest means of self-sufficiency for a crew habitat over the long term” [1].
            <br>
            <br>
            Food processing tools are the missing link in a sustainable food supply chain for long term space habitation. While the ISS contains a water dispenser, a food warmer, and even a test oven, there has been limited work to develop tools for in-situ processing of raw ingredients into delicious, nutritious food. Specifically, fluid-mediated cooking in microgravity poses challenges in terms of fluid and thermal management.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm working with Adam Zachar to design a device, nicknamed H0TP0T, to enable liquid-mediated cooking in partial gravity conditions. We'll test the first prototype on a parabolic flight in May 2021, made possible by an exciting collaboration with the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/space-exploration/overview/">MIT Media Lab Space Exploration Initiative</a>.

            <br>
            I use the tools of soft matter physics to 1) understand the kinetics of dehydration and rehydration of complex food structures and 2) develop food processing technologies that extend shelf-life without reducing palatability.
            <br>
            <br>
            The results from this project can improve eating conditions for astronauts on long duration missions to the Moon and Mars. Many demographics on Earth, including soldiers, refugees, and outdoor recreationists, also stand to benefit.

            <br>
            SIRONA is a radical new design for a Martian greenhouse, born out of a collaboration with Heather Hava of CU Boulder, Elizabeth Lombardi of Cornell, and other great colleagues.

            <br>
            From 2012 to 2017, I was the food scientist at <a href="https://modernistcuisine.com/" target="_blank">Modernist Cuisine</a>, an R&D-lab/publishing-house in Seattle founded by Nathan Myhrvold, former CTO of Microsoft.
            <br>
            <br>
            I designed and conducted experiments that established the scientific groundwork for the recipes and techniques covered in our books. I managed a team of research assistants, coordinated experiments with chef colleagues, and collaborated with the editorial team on science communication.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our work culminated in the publication of <a href=""https://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-bread/" target="_blank"><i>Modernist Bread</i></a>, a 5-volume book on the science and art of bread, in November 2017. It won a James Beard Award and an IACP Award in 2018.

            <br>
            I used to do a fair amount of fact-checking, mostly for science magazines. I love the details and like to help writers be clear and accurate. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Clients include <i>Scientific American</i>, <i>Knowable Magazine</i>, <i>Science News</i>, <i>The Alpinist</i>, and Amazon Publishing. Book work includes chapters of Eliza Griswold's <i>Amity and Prosperity</i>, winner of the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction.
