            Food is crucial to maintaining the physical and psychological health of humans in space. Eating food provides nutrients and energy. Preparing food can promote relaxation and creativity. Sharing food improves crew cohesion. But most foods are perishable, bulky, and heavy. For deep space missions, it is not feasible to ship all the food from Earth. Instead, growing and processing crops during deep space missions “represents the greatest means of self-sufficiency for a crew habitat over the long term” [1]. To date, experimental lettuce and kale grow aboard the ISS [2]. Designers propose playful concepts using VR and sound to enhance the dining experience for future astronauts and space tourists [3][4].
            <br>
            Food processing tools are the missing link in a sustainable food supply chain for long term space habitation. While the ISS contains a water dispenser, a food warmer, and even a test oven that first baked cookies in 2019 [5], there has been limited work to develop tools for in-situ processing of raw ingredients into delicious, nutritious food. Specifically, fluid-mediated cooking in microgravity poses challenges in terms of fluid and thermal management.
            <br>
            The Capillary Beverage Experiment launched to the ISS in 2015 successfully demonstrated passive fluid management for an edible liquid, in this case, coffee [5]. The Zero Gravity Kitchen oven installed on the ISS in 2019 allowed for baking for the first time on-orbit [6]. Our work builds upon the successful thermal and fluid management demonstrated in these two individual systems. As far as we are aware, this is the first system developed to boil food in microgravity.

            We're building a device to enable liquid-mediated cooking in partial gravity conditions. The cooking vessel depends on capillary action and specialized geometry for passive fluid management in microgravity.

            <font color="#00cc66">DEHYDRATION AND REHDYRATION IN FOOD SYSTEMS</font>
            <br>
            I use the tools of soft matter physics to 1) understand the kinetics of dehydration and rehydration of complex food structures and 2) develop food processing technologies that extend shelf-life without reducing palatability.
            <br>
            <br>
            The results from this project can improve eating conditions for astronauts on long duration missions to the Moon and Mars. Many demographics on Earth, including soldiers, refugees, and outdoor recreationists, also stand to benefit.

            <font color="#00cc66">SIRONA, A BIOREGENERATIVE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM</font>
            <br>
            SIRONA is a radical new design for a Martian greenhouse, born out of my collaboration with Heather Hava of CU Boulder, Lizzie Lombardi of Cornell, and other great colleagues.
            <br>
            <br>
            I contributed elements related to post-harvest processing, kitchen layout, and nutritional analysis.
            <br>
            <br>
            SIRONA won the award for Most Innovative Concept at the <a href="http://bigidea.nianet.org/past-competition-themes/2019-competition/" target="_blank">2019 NASA BIG Idea Challenge</a> in Langley, VA. In 2019, we also presented SIRONA's architecture and technology at <a href="https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/handle/2346/84413" target="_blank">ICES</a> and its design philosophy and projected performance at IAC.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our next step is to build and test prototypes of SIRONA subsystems in Mars analogue environments.

            <font color="#00cc66">MODERNIST BREAD</font>
            <br>
            From 2012 to 2017, I was the food scientist at <a href="https://modernistcuisine.com/" target="_blank">Modernist Cuisine</a>, an R&D-lab/publishing-house in Seattle founded by Nathan Myhrvold, former CTO of Microsoft.
            <br>
            <br>
            I designed and conducted experiments that established the scientific groundwork for the recipes and techniques covered in our books. I managed a small group of research assistants, coordinated experiments with chef colleagues, and collaborated with the editorial team on science communication.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our work culminated in the publication of <a href=""https://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-bread/" target="_blank"><i>Modernist Bread</i></a>, a 5-volume book on the science and art of bread, in November 2017. It won a James Beard Award and an IACP Award in 2018.

            <br>
            I dabble in fact-checking, mostly science journalism. I like to help writers communicate science clearly and accurately.
            <br>
            <br>
            Clients include <i>Scientific American</i>, <i>Knowable Magazine</i>, <i>Science News</i>, <i>The Alpinist</i>, and Amazon Publishing. Book work includes chapters of Eliza Griswold's <i>Amity and Prosperity</i>, winner of the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction.
