<p>Have you ever found yourself doing something that you really want to stop doing, but you keep going anyways?</p>

<p>A few examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>R is bored working on his current company but is reluctant to start something new</li>
  <li>Z continues putting in the hours at a company that irritates her morals</li>
  <li>B wants to feel content in his business but is always anxiously plotting for the next big win</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually, people will conclude that they’re not very disciplined. Not disciplined enough to start a new business, not disciplined enough to steer the project in a more fulfilling direction, not disciplined enough to find peace in the present moment.</p>

<p>But being trapped in these cycles aren’t really about insufficient willpower or motivation. They are about something much deeper.</p>

<p>We say we want freedom, creativity, rest, but then find ourselves doing the opposite. That’s usually a sign of a <em>Defender Value</em>: a hidden value quietly protecting something important, like safety, belonging, or approval.</p>

<p>I put together this short worksheet called <strong>Find Your Defender Value</strong>. It’s a 10-minute reflection to help you spot what your patterns are really protecting.</p>

<p>Every behavior makes sense in context. It was your best attempt to meet a real need. By understanding these patterns, you can begin to update the old contracts that keep them in charge and create a life that aligns with your true values.</p>
